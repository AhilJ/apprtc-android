This Android project is a mirror of the Android AppRTC demo found in the [webrtc project](https://code.google.com/p/webrtc/). However, this Android application will be maintained as an Android Studio project. **Note that the sources in this project are not in any way ours. We are just mirroring what is already available to developers in an Android project form so developers can work with a functioning AppRTC prototype without cloning and building WebRTC**


Development
=============
This project was created using Android Studio and will be maintained moving forward as such. The goal for this project is to maintain an easily consumable AppRTC demo application without the hassle of maintaing a WebRTC repository.

All libjingle dependencies used within this project are built with our [build scripts](https://github.com/pristineio/webrtc-build-scripts) and available in Maven central.


Modifications
=============
This repository is meant to be a starting point for exploration with WebRTC on Android. Only configuration based changes will be considered for this repository. The sources for the application will not be different from what is available within the WebRTC project. If you have some changes for the application that you think are relevant, feel free to test them out with this project, but please contribute to the official [WebRTC repository](https://code.google.com/p/webrtc/) and the changes will be incorporated here.


Updates
==============
We won't make any promises on periodic updates to this repository, but rest assured we interact with WebRTC on a daily basis and if any noteworthy updates become available we will update the project shortly thereafter.
